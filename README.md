# README

## Overview
This project contains MATLAB scripts and custom functions for various image processing tasks. The main functionality is executed through the **Main.m** file, and additional results and tasks can be verified as outlined below.

## Instructions for Running the Code

1. **Main Script Execution**:
   - Run the **Main.m** file to check the results for each task.
   - Ensure all necessary files and dependencies are in the same directory as the main script.

2. **Image 2 - Task 7 & Task 8**:
   - Results for these tasks can be checked in the **KNN_model** subfolder.
   - Run the files with "test" in their names to execute and verify the results.

3. **Directory Placement for KNN Files**:
   - Files in the **KNN_model** folder rely on a specific directory structure.
   - Ensure the same directory hierarchy is maintained to avoid errors while running these scripts.

4. **Bonus Task Results**:
   - To check results for the bonus task, navigate to **Prj_grp_22 > KNN_model > Task8 > KNN_testing_HOG_edge_feats**.
   - Follow the instructions mentioned in the comments within the code to make the necessary changes before running.

## Additional Notes
- Ensure MATLAB is installed and properly configured before running the scripts.
- If you encounter issues related to file paths or dependencies, verify the directory structure as described above.
- The custom functions used in the project are documented for clarity and ease of understanding.
